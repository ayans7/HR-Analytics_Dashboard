# Use Case: HR Analytics Dashboard for Employee Performance & Retention
Tool Used: Power BI
Domain: Human Resources Analytics

# Objective: 
To analyze years of employee data and build an interactive, dynamic Power BI dashboard to improve employee performance, reduce attrition, and enhance overall HR decision-making.

# Project Overview:
In this project, I developed a dynamic HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, leveraging historical employee data to uncover key insights related to employee performance and attrition. The goal was to support the HR team in making data-driven decisions to improve employee retention, enhance performance, and optimize the employee experience.

# Key Features and Techniques:
Data Transformation: Cleaned, structured, and transformed raw HR data into professional-quality reports and dashboards.

Interactive Filters: Implemented slicers and filter buttons for seamless navigation across different views by year, department, job role, etc.

KPI Cards: Created 6 KPI cards to display high-level HR metrics such as total employees, attrition rate, average tenure, employee satisfaction score, gender diversity ratio, and training participation.

Attrition Insights:

KPI Chart: Visualized attrition by gender to highlight demographic trends.

Donut Chart: Showed attrition by education level for easier identification of patterns.

Additional Charts: Used various visuals (bar, line, and column charts) to analyze attrition across:

1. Age groups
2. Salary slabs
3. Years at company
4. Job roles

Job Satisfaction Table: Displayed job satisfaction scores by job role to pinpoint departments that need attention.

Stacked Column Charts: Illustrated attrition distribution across different job roles for comparative analysis.

# Business Impact:
Through detailed analysis and visualization, the dashboard helped the organization to:

1. Identify key factors contributing to employee attrition
2. Enhance the hiring process by understanding successful employee profiles
3. Improve employee experience through targeted engagement strategies
4. Boost workforce productivity by aligning resources to areas with high satisfaction and low attrition
5. Build employee trust with transparency and data-driven HR policies
